Please note, as we are a group of only 2 people it was much more difficult for us to discuss the results and intepretation of the graphs. We researched and discussed together for all answers and would love any input in regards to them. 

We did, however, write 2 different versions of the same algorithms. One is written in C++ and the other in Python; to see what kind of effect the different scripting languages had on the running. 

All times in the report are from the C++ version, however the Python version led to very similar runtimes/scales. 

Both programs have their own ReadMe's in their prospective zips.
